  Apply background, text, and border colors across breakpoints using consistent class names.

- **Interaction States**  
  Built-in `hover:` and `focus:` support for color, spacing, and layout utilities.

- **Spacing System**  
  Directional padding and margin classes (`mt-*`, `px-*`) including fractional values (`p-0_5`, `m-1_25`).

- **Transition Utilities**  
  Utility classes for animations (`transition-all`, `duration-200`, `ease-in-out`).

- **Breakpoint Engine**  
  Customizable keys for generating responsive variants (`sm:bg-*`, `lg:p-4`, `md:hover:m-2`).

- **Safe Class Interpolation**  
  Fractional values are sanitized to avoid invalid CSS selectors.

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Utility layers organized into isolated Sass files (`_colors.scss`, `_spacing.scss`, `_interaction.scss`, etc.).

- **Debug Grid & Meta Compatibility**  
  Optional debug grid for visual testing and mobile-ready viewport setup.
